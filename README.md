## About Me
I'm Naythan (Nathaniel Limiac), a 1st-year BSIS student at City College of Angeles. I'm passionate about coding and diving into the world of programming languages. Currently, I'm exploring various languages and technologies to enhance my skills.

I have a certificate in C Language and am expanding my knowledge in areas like web development, software engineering, and data structures. Iâ€™m particularly excited about building web applications, learning about frontend and backend development, and contributing to open-source projects.

I enjoy problem-solving, tackling challenges, and growing my skills with every project. Feel free to connect with me or check out my work here!
